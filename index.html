    <h2>Summary</h2><br>
    <p>
        I started my career as an agricultural researcher.  My research led me to weird 
        and wonderful places.  I did research on free ranging Impala, assisted with 
        grazing studies on elephants, did carnivore censuses and game 
        counts on foot, by vehicle or helicopter.  I acted as tourist guide, participated in
        field assessments and game capture and relocation.  These activities were not well
        defined and required a lot of problem identification, ideation, prototyping, 
        testing and starting over. Most of all it required team work!
    </p>    
    <p>
        After this exciting roller coaster and somewhat daunting part off my life
        I got married and settled into research.  My research focus was on increasing efficiency
        of production, increasing welfare standards and ultimately finding alternatives
        to the everyday products and system that we used.  These alternatives were
        sought for anti-microbial growth promotors, energy sources and protein sources.

       The most educational part of my life was during consultation, since I was unbiased 
       clients trusted me with lots of info and, since I could not share this with anybody
       else, I ended up with a vast amount of knowledge gained from other people's 
       experience.  During this time we changed industries and increased the profitability 
       of intensive farming enterprises.
    </p>
    <p>
        I was very fortunate to lecture at many Universities and Technicons. I presented 
        short courses to industry and presented lectures at many congresses, conferences and 
        symposia, both locally and abroad.  This showed me that what I deem to be common could
        be very valuable to other people and that many people thirst for this knowledge.  I did 
        not have the skill set to develop this and only learned how to create value from this 
        knowledge for both clients and myself.
    </p>
    <p> 
        I believe in our youth and that they are the key to positive change.  I lecture to young
        adults and not only do I teach them subject matter but I also teach them to be fair,
        and honest.  I teach them to think and to maintain a strong ethical code.  I also invest 
        in the little ones and present courses on nature, leadership and entrepreneurship to school
        going children.
    </p>
    <p>
        I believe that a person should never stop learning and my latest endeavours have resulted
        in me learning a bit of code, doing website development, online store development and online
        training courses.  This added a lot of value to my life.  On the one hand it reduced my dependency
        on my employer while on the other hand it empowered me to add value to lives of people who 
        desperately needed help in these fields but do not have the means to access this.
    </p>     
        My moto in life is simple - if you can imagine it then you can do it.
        This stems from the wide range of experiences that I was so blessed to have during my 
        life, preparing me in a way which makes me excellent at using a 
        multidisciplinary approach to problem identification and problem 
        solving using innovative means.  Failure is just never an option and 
        difficulties only lead to greater success.
